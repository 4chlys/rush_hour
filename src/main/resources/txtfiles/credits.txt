A long time ago in a codebase far, far away...

RUSH HOUR
EPISODE I
ESCAPE THE GRID

It is a time of great traffic congestion.
The brave developers of the Java Order,
led by Romeo Weyns and Casper Borgonjon,
have embarked on a quest to create the ultimate
puzzle challenge, where only the cleverest
can escape the dreaded gridlock.

With guidance from the wise masters
of the Java Council, and armed with
nothing but their keyboards and boundless caffeine,
they have crafted an adventure that will test
the patience and wits of all who dare enter.

Meanwhile, the Debugging Sith Lords
plot in the shadows, throwing NullPointerExceptions
and off-by-one errors into their path.

But hope remains! With the power of logic,
determination, and a touch of the Stack Overflow Force,
the developers press onward.

Now, the challenge falls to you, brave player.
Will you master the grid and restore balance
to the rush hour chaos? Or will you remain
forever trapped in the eternal jam?

May the Code be with you... Always.
